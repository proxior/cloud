 SMS Spoof allows you to send an SMS message to someone and change who it's from (the **Sender**). For example, you could send a message to someone and make the sender "**Ex Girlfriend**" and set the message body to "**I'm Pregnant!!**" In the images below, there's an example of how that will look on the recipient phone

## Setup
Currently SMSSpoof only supports the [Twilio SMS API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/message). In the future there will be support for other SMS API's such as MessageBird, Sinch, Nexmo, etc... If you have a request for specific communications API to be added then post a request in the [Issues area](./issues).

### Requirements
 * A [Twilio](http://twilio.com) account
 * Any WebServer (*Eg, NGINX/Apache*)
 * PHP version 5.3 or higher

### Installation
Clone this repo into your WebServer document root

    git clone https://github.com/vpn/SMSSpoof.git /var/www/SMSSpoof

Edit the config file _(core/config.php)_ and add your **AccountSID** and **AuthToken** to the file. You can find your AccountSID and AuthToken within the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console). They can be seen in the image here
![Screenshot of Twilio account details](http://i.stuf.io/131bzq3n8383270.png)

You need to uncomment the **AccountSid** and **AuthToken** elements in the `$config` array and add your details. It should look something like
```PHP
    $config = array(
        ...
        'AccountSid'        =>  'AC0a2e643f97adc9zzx19h527ghgt71967',
        'AuthToken'         =>  '71wvx21vx79uxuy2ywz92xzxwz657y3x'
    );
```

## Usage
To send a message to someone you need to go to the site `http://yourwebsite.io/SMSSPoof/`. How you access the website will depend on how you have set up your webserver.

You need to fill in all fields,
* **Sender** - This is who you want the recipient to think the message is from. In my first example I was texting someone "I'm Pregnant" from their "Ex Girlfriend", so in that case the Sender would be _Ex Girlfriend_. There are some restrictions that limit what you can enter as the Sender, these restrictions are outlined in the **Restrictions** section, just below the form.
* **Recipient** - This is the number of who you want to send the message to. Make sure that the country that you are sending the message to supports Alphanumeric Sender ID's. A list of the supported countries can be seen in the **Supported Countries** section.
* **Message** - This is the body of the SMS that is being sent. You are limited to 160 characters. This is because after 160 characters messages are then concatenated and may display differently in international countries.
